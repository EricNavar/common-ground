# What is common ground

- We propose building a mobile app called Common Ground that will help groups of people to identify nearby restaurants that appeal to the preferences of all the individuals involved. All of the individuals will join the same group in the app and input their personal preferences on food and restaurants. Preferences include the style of cuisine, restaurant pricing, proximity, restaurant rating, and so on.
- The app will then run those preferences through an algorithm to generate a list of nearby restaurants ordered by the number of preferences honored. The users will be able to scroll through the list and vote on a restaurant or have the app randomly decide for them. After the meal, the users will be invited to share their feedback on the restaurant choice. Using these responses, the appâ€™s machine learning model will recommend new restaurants that the group might also enjoy for their next meal.
